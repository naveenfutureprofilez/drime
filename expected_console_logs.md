# Expected Console Logs for Multi-File Upload (Clean & Minimal)

## When uploading 2 files (e.g., two 400MB files):

### Initial Upload Start:
```
🚀 Starting TUS upload for 1 files
📋 Multi-file upload breakdown: { selectedItems: 1, totalFiles: 2, fileDetails: [...], uploadStrategy: 'sequential (first file creates group, others follow)' }
📊 Total upload size: 800 MB across 2 files
🧹 Cleared previous upload state and progress tracking
🎬 Upload Strategy:
   1️⃣ First: file1.zip (400 MB) - creates upload group  
   2️⃣ Queued: file2.zip (400 MB) - waits for group hash
🥇 Starting first file upload: file1.zip
⏳ Queued 1 files for sequential upload after group creation
```

### During First File Upload:
```
🚀 Creating upload for: file1.zip (400 MB) - FIRST file
📄 Encoded filename: file1.zip → ZmlsZTEuemlw
🔑 Creating file entry with upload key: abc123def456
📤 Sending file entry request: {...}
📝 File entry created: {...}
🏷️ Upload group created: hash_abc123
```

### First File Completion:
```
✅ TUS Upload Complete for: file1.zip
✅ file1.zip completed. Files: 1/2
⏳ 1/2 files done, 50% overall progress
🚀 Starting 1 remaining files
📤 Starting file2.zip
```

### During Second File Upload:
```
🚀 Creating upload for: file2.zip (400 MB) - SUBSEQUENT file
```

### All Files Complete:
```
✅ TUS Upload Complete for: file2.zip
✅ file2.zip completed. Files: 2/2
🎉 ALL FILES DONE - showing share link
```

## Key Behaviors Fixed:

1. **Progress Calculation**: Shows ~50% when first file completes, 100% when both complete
2. **Sequential Upload**: Second file starts 5 seconds after first completes (prevents rate limiting)
3. **Completion Logic**: Share link only appears when ALL files are uploaded
4. **Clean Logging**: Minimal, informative logs - no spam or debug noise
5. **Error Handling**: Clear rate limiting detection and retry logic

## Expected UI Behavior:

- Progress circle shows gradual increase (0% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%)
- "266 MB of 731 MB" text updates correctly during upload
- Share link appears only after 100% completion
- Both files visible in shared link when opened
- No "too many requests" errors with 5-second delays
