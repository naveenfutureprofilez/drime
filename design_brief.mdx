# Lightweight Design Brief

This document outlines the design specifications for a file uploader component, including color palette, iconography, and component anatomy.

## Color Palette

We'll use a vibrant primary and secondary color palette to create a modern and engaging user interface.

*   **Primary Color (Indigo):** `#4F46E5`
*   **Secondary Color (Emerald):** `#10B981`

## Iconography

We will use the [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) library for our icon set. The following icons (solid style) will be used to represent the different states of the file uploader.

*   **Idle:** `ArrowUpTrayIcon`
*   **Uploading:** `ArrowPathIcon` (with a spin animation)
*   **Success:** `CheckCircleIcon`
*   **Failure:** `XCircleIcon`

## Component Anatomy Mock-up

Here is a conceptual mock-up of the file uploader's components.

### 1. Dropzone

The dropzone is the initial interaction point for the user.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                                                  |
|          +-----------------+                     |
|          |  <Icon: Idle>   |                     |
|          +-----------------+                     |
|                                                  |
|   Drag & drop files here, or click to browse.    |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### 2. File Preview Card

After a file is selected, a preview card is displayed for each file.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  [IMG]  filename.jpg      [<Icon: Remove>]      |
|         1.2 MB                                   |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### 3. Progress Bar

During an upload, the progress bar is shown within the file preview card.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  [IMG]  filename.jpg      [<Icon: Uploading>]   |
|         [███████████████████      ] 75%          |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### 4. Error Banner

If an upload fails, an error banner is displayed.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  <Icon: Failure>  Upload failed. Please try again. |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```
